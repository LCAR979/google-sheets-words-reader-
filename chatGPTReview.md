# Code Review from ChatGPT on v0.1

There are several areas where this code could be improved:

Security: The API key is hardcoded in the script, which can be a security vulnerability. It would be better to store the API key in a separate configuration file that is not included in the code repository, or to use an environment variable.

Error handling: The script does not handle errors very well. For example, if the sheet ID is not found in the URL, or if there is an error fetching the data from the Google Sheets API, the script displays an alert but does not provide any additional information. It would be better to provide more informative error messages, or to log the errors to the console.

Performance: The script fetches all the data in the specified range from the Google Sheets API, which could be slow if the range is very large. It would be better to fetch the data in smaller chunks, or to use pagination to limit the amount of data returned.

Usability: The script adds a "Read" button to the Google Sheets menu bar, but it does not provide any instructions or guidance on how to use the feature. It would be better to provide some documentation or tooltips to help users understand how to use the feature.

Code quality: The code could be better organized and more modular. For example, the fetchData function could be separated into its own module, and the speakWords function could be refactored to use a generator instead of recursion. Additionally, the code could benefit from more comments and documentation to make it easier to understand and maintain.
